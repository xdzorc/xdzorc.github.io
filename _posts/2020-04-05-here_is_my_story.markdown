 Where do I start? I suppose everyone join Flatiron online software engineering program has a story behind it.

Here is my version. I finished my Ph.D degree in chemical engineering  from University of Pittsbrugh back in 2012, and two years post-doc research following that. Unfortunely, the more I strived academically, the more lost I felt about my
 future and life in general. All of sudden, I was 31 years old. Time to change career to areas  I would enjoy? It really required considerable amount of courage and devotion. Right then and there, I had two choices, one was becoming a programmer, the other starting my own business. I chose the latter, started recyling post-industrial plastic and exporting to China. In the end, my ambition cost almost 5 years of my life. However, I tried something I always wanted, and surrended to the reality that I didn't have the skill set for a successful business. 

At this point, you can imagine the position I was in. Should I go back to learn coding? I am already 36 years old, is it too late? All these questions haunts me everyday. Meanwhile, I witness the whole internet technology industry just keep growing extremely fast, and a couple of my good friends successfully switched career becoming programmers. Being hesitant to pull the trigger will not help my situation. I started self-learning Java language, in order to find out whether I am able to enjoy being a programmer.  It turned out that I really enjoyed this little test and wanting to solve more problems. The big revelation is that at its core, coding is built on logic along with Math(algorithm), both of which I am familiar with and good at(start gaining confidence). 

After necessary comparisons among plenty online coding programs and  friends' recommendations, I finally made the decision to join Flatiron online software engineering program. So far I have enjoyed my program greatly. At the end of the first mile, I think I am ready to take on new challenges and excel at it in the end. It is not easy, especially when your code does not work... it can be extremely frustrating. But though this excuciating process, you become stronger and better, just like learning everything else. Eventually it will just be rewarding.

This day and age, we have to keep learning to be competitave. Programming itself definitely requires it. Graduating from this program, not only we may be able to start a exciting career, but it teachs us how to learn and keeps our mind sharp.

Here I send out my sincere prayer to myself and fellow classmates, "good luck and enjoy!".
