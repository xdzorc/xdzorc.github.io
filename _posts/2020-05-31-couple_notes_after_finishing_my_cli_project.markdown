Starting the Cli project week, I was kinda freaking out. I have learned all the tools to build this program, somehow don't know where to start. I think because I am so used to test driven tasks, now, we have to kinda write the tasks in our head by ourselves, which is challenging.

First, finding the right data source is crucial, either through apis or scraping. Apis are just so orgranized and easy to use, problem is that those pulic apis without key requirement does not provide enough information to make my cli project interesting. So I had to scrape, it got really frustrating really fast. Problems were as following, such as "finding the right css selectors", "manipulating strings and arrays to extract information", "multiple layer scraping to collect data". But after a while, I really acquired all that I needed. 

Second, building the classes for all objects manipulation is the conerstone of the project . But this part was not challenging, since we had plenty practice in our labs. The key part was to figure out how you want users to accessor to the data you collected. After figuring that out, everything else just came along.

Third, building the cli command central could get really frustrating. Lots of loop were involved, especially  I wanted my program could go couple levels deep. Muti-layer looping was a must. I spent  most time to write this part. Why was it not working? Why was it not following my command? There were considerable amount checking errors back and forth between classes and cli files. On the hind sight, I really improved my skills mostly through this part, understanding fundamentals such as loop, if statement, has-many relationship or has-many-through relationship. 

After fixing the cli command central, the world just turned beautiful, the feeling was extremely satisfying. Watching the program you built does exactly what it supposed to do, the feeling is inaffable. I guess  the final keynote to myself is that when you work for super long hours,  the right thing to do is to rest, the next day you just see everything clearer. Letting your brain rest and process all that information is neceserray. Forcing it after exhaustion will almost guarantee failure and frustration.

I sincerely hope all my classmates are doing well, and let's move on to the next chapter! (Special thanks to our cohort leader Jenn!)
